Background:
I was working on a rather simple video conversion tool, based around the
ffmpeg tool, when I realized how painful interfacing with a command line
utility from Cocoa would be. I went through with development anyway, only
to find my original expectations to be true. I briefly tried to simply use
the libraries directly in the application, but soon found them to be
impossibly messy.

Goal:
That's where CAConversionFramework comes in. The goal of the framework
is to provide a full-featured Cocoa API, allowing developers to create
feature-rich video converters, of both wide and narrow scope. 
CAConversionFramework is designed to be extensible and also easy to
understand.

A few notes:
	* CAConversionFramework is not even close to being done. Currently
	it is basically useless.
	* The prefix "CA" is used as they are my initials:  try not to get
	them confused with Apple's use of CA, to mean Core Animation.
	* CAConversionFramework makes use of Grand Central Dispatch, which
	means it requires OS 10.6 or later.
	* The "Vidiot" project is provided just as a test application.

Basic Layout:
The framework is centralized around CAConversion objects, which represent
a video conversion:  either preparing to be run, running, or completed.
CAConversion objects are monitored and managed by a shared class known
as the CAConversionCenter (think of NSNotificationCenter, etc.) Each 
CAConversion object has many objects associated with it, including info
objects, streams, etc. All of these can be accessed using simple getters
and setters.
